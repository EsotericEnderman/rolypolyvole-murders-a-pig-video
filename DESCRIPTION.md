This was the most insane event in the history of The Slimy Swamp. It would change the history of our server forever. This devious act remains highly debated and discussed to this day.

This recording of the historic Slimaean pig genocide of 2022 was found after the war with Shekloria. Sheklorian troops returned this artefact to the government of Shekloria led by Crybabygrinch to be examined later. It would reveal the death of King Pig, who was very important to the country of Shekloria.

Sheklorians knew this was the foul play of the conjoined forces of Slimaea and the angry birds. Due to this event, they knew they had to act quick before the pig genocide began. Shekloria launched its attack on Slimaea on June 16th, 2022. The war with Shekloria was the most deadly war that The Slimy Swamp has ever experienced. However, in the end, Shekloria would come out victorious. But by the time they had arrived at the Slimaean capital, the pig genocide had already happened. Shekloria was devasted, and a period of great economic recession and despair followed.

This ancient artefact remains one of the most critical pieces of historical evidence on The Slimy Swamp to date. It shows that during times of desperation, human nature can allow for anything to happen, even if it is morally devious.

The perpetrator of this diabolical act (rolyPolyVole) would face trial in Nuremberg on the 13th of October, 2022. He was sentenced to 2 years on the Bekfast Discord server. This punishment remains controversial, as many say that he was just following orders and that this punishment is worse than death, but it was followed through anyway.
